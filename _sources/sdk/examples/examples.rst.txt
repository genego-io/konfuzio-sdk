Human in the loop of machine learning
--------------------------------------

The tutorial for the *Human in the Loop of Machine Learning* aims to show you how to use the
Konfuzio SDK package to include an easy feedback workflow in your training pipeline. It also gives an example of how you
can take advantage of open-source models to speed up the annotation process.

You can download it from
`here <https://github.com/konfuzio-ai/document-ai-python-sdk/blob/master/docs/sdk/examples/human_in_the_loop.ipynb>`_
and try it by yourself.
